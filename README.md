# TripleTen Projects (formerly PracticumProjects)

My repository of projects I felt were my best work during the bootcamp.

| Project name | Description | Libraries used |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
|[Insurance Company Data Obfuscation](insurance_company)| The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of Machine Learning, and you are asked to evaluate that possibility. Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing. Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a prediction model do better than a dummy model? Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model. Task 4: Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.| *pandas, sklearn, numpy* |
|[Taxi Orders Model](taxi_orders)| Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction. The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48. | *pandas, statsmodels.tsa.seasonal, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, lightgbm* |
|[Movie Review Sentiment Analysis](movie_review)| The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. You'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. It will need to reach an F1 score of at least 0.85 | *math, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm* |
|[Grocery Chain Model](grocery_chain)| The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind: The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol. Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo. The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age. To start working on the task, you'll have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated. | *pandas, tensorflow, PIL, glob, numpy, matplotlib.py* |

*Projects are listed in the order that they were completed.*
